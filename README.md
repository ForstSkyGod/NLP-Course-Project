# NLP-Course-Project
Build a translation (zh-en) based on rnn &amp; transformer

## Training:
Use trans_nmt.py or rnn_nmt.py to train from scratch by your self or fine-tune the google/mt5.
Use inference.py to make a quick start after you have the trained model.

Make sure every path in the code is correct for you before `python inference.py`
